    <h1>Measuring Units</h1>
    <p style="margin: 1rem 3%">
      Measuring units plays a very important role in styling a webpage. All
      these units mentioned below are commonly used by the developer. Where
      there are allot of Css measuring units
    </p>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="row-box pixels">
        <h2>Px - Pixels</h2>
        <p>
          The are the most fundamental units to measure a websites elements. An
          it is widely used as a base units and other as over it. All the other
          units like em and rem work only when px units are declared as base
          size. Px is used to give a size factor to the font, container width
          and in every html element sizing unit is must.
        </p>
        <div class="examples">
          <p class="width-in-px">This div has a width and height of 50px</p>
          <p class="font-size-px">This font has 30px of the font-size</p>
        </div>
        <div class="row-box percentage">
          <h2>% - percentage</h2>
          <p style="margin: 5px 0">
            This percentage unit is used when we are trying to give sizing based
            on the parents container width.
          </p>
          <div class="examples">
            <div class="width-in-per">
              <div>
                The width of this container is 50% percent of its parent. That
                is the parent width is 300px and the child width will be 150px
              </div>
            </div>
            <p class="font-size-per">
              Percentage in font is not widely used but it set the font-size to
              the 100% of the base-font-size of the page or its parent. Now the
              font-size of its parent is set to 30px and the font-size of this
              is set to 50% that is 50px.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row-box em">
          <h2>em units</h2>
          <p>
            Em units are pretty much similar to the percentage unit but it adds
            the size based on the parents font size and it don't inherit the
            page font-size. Here 1em is = entire font size. Example 1em of 10px
            is 10px. This unit can be used to create a relative environment in a
            container. For Example: Styling buttons when the border-radius
            should be much relative to width when the width is changed even the
            border-radius must be changed.
          </p>
          <div class="examples">
            <div class="width-in-em">
              <div>
                The width of this container is 15em .That is the parent 15x size
                of the parents font-size. this parents font-size is set to 10px
                then the width will be 50px
              </div>
            </div>
            <p class="font-size-em">
              The font-size is set to 1.5em that is 15px. Based on the
              parent-font-size all the child elements can be sized
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row-box rem">
          <h2>Rem units</h2>
          <p>
            Rem units are the units used to style the entire pages elements
            based on one default font-size. The font size is declared in the
            html query styling and that font-size is set as default font size of
            that page. Example if the html font size is 10px then 1rem unit will
            be 10px no matter in which container you get the same size. These
            units can be used in any Css property following border, padding,
            margin, border-radius and much more.
          </p>
          <div class="examples">
            <div class="width-in-rem">
              The width of this container is 30rem that is 300px. The page
              font-size is set to 10px. 30X times of the base font-size
            </div>
            <p class="font-size-rem">
              The font-size is set to 2rem that is 20px.
            </p>
          </div>
