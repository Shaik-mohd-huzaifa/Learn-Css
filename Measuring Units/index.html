            <div>The width of this container is 50% percent of its parent. That is the parent width is 300px and the child width will be 150px</div></div>
          <p class="font-size-per">Percentage in font is not widely used but it set the font-size to the 100% of the base-font-size of the page or its parent. Now the font-size of its parent is set to 30px and the font-size of this is set to 50% that is 50px.</p>
